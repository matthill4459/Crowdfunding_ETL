## Getting Started
1. Download the starter files from either the class repo or from the bootcamp website (project 2)
2. Run all of the cells in the ETL_Mini_Project_MHill_BBelczak.ipynb file. Doing this should clean and organize all of the data in the 2 excel files (contacts.xlsx, and crowdfunding.xlsx). This will create 4 csv files - (campaign.csv, category.csv, subcategor.csv and contacts.csv).
3. Go to this website [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com) and create an ERD of the csv files you just made and save the new ERD file. ERD schema shoude look like image show below:
